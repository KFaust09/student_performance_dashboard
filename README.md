# student_performance_dashboard
Analyze test scores, attendance, and trends. Add slicers for filtering by grade, subject, etc.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- Power Query
- Pivot Tables & Charts

## Data Source
[Kaggle: Student Performance in Exams] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## Process
- Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query.
- Created new metrics:
- Built an interactive dashboard with slicers and visualizations.

## Key Insights
- Test Prep Impact on Average Scores by Gender <br>
Purpose: To understand how completing a test preparation course affects student performance, with a breakdown by gender.
  - What is the average performance difference between students who completed the test prep course and those who didn't?
  - Does test prep benefit one gender more than the other?
  - Is there a significant gender gap in scores regardless of test prep completion?
  - Do students who don't complete test prep still achieve high scores in any cases?
  - How might test prep programs be optimized based on this data?
- Score by Parental Education <br>
Purpose: To examine how a parent's education level might influence student performance across subjects.
  - Do students with parents who have higher education consistently score better?
  - How does parental education differently affect each subject (Math, Reading, Writing)?
  - Are there noticeable differences in average scores between "pass" and "fail" groups based on parental education level?
  - Is the impact of parental education consistent across gender or race/ethnicity?
  - Are certain education levels more influential than others?
  
- Student Count by Race and Gender <br>
Purpose: To visualize the distribution of performance results across racial and ethnic groups and gender.
  - Are certain race/ethnicity groups overrepresented in either high or low performance categories?
  - Do gender performance trends differ across racial groups?
  - Which race/ethnicity group has the highest overall performance?
  - Are there equity or access issues suggested by this distribution?
  - How might this data inform targeted academic support?
